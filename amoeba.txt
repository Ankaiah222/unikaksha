The environmental eco club  have discovered a new Amoeba that grows in the order of a Fibonacci series every month. They are exhibiting their amoeba in a national 
conference. They want to know the size of the amoeba at a particular time instant. If a particular month’s index is given can you write a  program that displays the 
amoeba’s size……???//Use Dynamic Programming Strategy Note: The size of the amoeba on month 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7 ..will be 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 respectively.
Sample input and Output 1:
Enter the number of Months :
7
The amoeba size is 8

Solution:
print("Enter the number of Months :")
months = int(input())
first_term = -1
second_term = 1
result = ""
for i in range(1,months+1):
    sum = first_term+second_term
    first_term = second_term
    second_term = sum
    result = result + str(sum)+" "
#print(result)
list_1 = result.split()
print("The amoeba size is "+str(list_1[months-1]))
