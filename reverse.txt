Write program to reverse a number is discussed here. We can reverse a number using loop and arithmetic operators in both iterative and recursive approaches. 
Sample Input: 
13579
Sample Output: 
97531

Solution:
n = int(input())
reverse = ""
for i in str(n):
    reverse = i + reverse
print(int(reverse))
