Sheela has three things in her bag. She wants to compute the area of 3 things but 3 things are in different shapes. The three things are in square shape, rectangular
shape, and circular shape respectively. Write a program to help Sheela to calculate the area of different shapes.
Sample Input: 
5
5

2.0
Sample Output: 
25
20
12.56

Solution:
side = int(input())
length = int(input())
breadth = int(input())
radius = float(input())
area_of_square = side*side
print(area_of_square)
area_of_rectangle= length*breadth
print(area_of_rectangle)
radius_of_circle=3.14*radius*radius
print("%.2f"%radius_of_circle)
