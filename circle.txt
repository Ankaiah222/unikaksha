 write a program that determines if two circles intersect each other. The input to your program will be the <x, y> coordinates for the center of 
each circle, followed by the radius(r) of each circle. The output will state whether the circles overlap, do not overlap, or are tangential .
Sample Input 1:
10
10
3
10
6
1
Sample Output 1:
The circles are tangential

Solution:
x1 = int(input())
y1 = int(input())
r1 = int(input())
x2 = int(input())
y2 = int(input())
r2 = int(input())
d = ((x2-x1)**2 + (y2-y1)**2)**0.5
if int(d) < r1+r2:
    print("The circles overlap")
elif int(d) == r1+r2:
    print("The circles are tangential")
else:
    print("The circles do not overlap")
