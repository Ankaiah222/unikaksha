A microwave oven manufacturer recommends that when heating two items, add 50% to the heating time, and when heating three items double the heating time. Heating more 
than three items at once is not recommended. Write a program that asks the user for the number of items and the single-item heating time. The program then writes out the 
recommended heating time
Sample Input and Output 1:
Enter the number of items
2
Enter the single item heating time
5.0
The recommended heating time is 7.50

Solution:
print("Enter the number of items")
no_of_items = int(input())
print("Enter the single item heating time")
heating_time = float(input())
if no_of_items == 2:
    heating_time = heating_time+(heating_time)*50/100
    print("The recommended heating time is "+str("%.2f"%heating_time))
elif no_of_items == 3:
    heating_time = 2*heating_time
    print("The recommended heating time is "+str("%.2f"%heating_time))
else:
    print("Number of items is more")
