numbers in a given range using loop
Sample Input: 
1
10
Sample Output:
2
3
5
7

Solution:
m = int(input())
n = int(input())
if m < 2:
    m =2
for i in range(m,n):
    factors = 0
    for j in range(2,i):
        if i % j == 0:
            factors = factors + 1
    if factors == 0:
        print(i)
