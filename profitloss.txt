A fruitseller buys a dozen mango at Rs.X. He sells 1 mango at Rs.Y. Write a program to determine the profit or loss in Rs. for the fruitseller.
Sample Input1:
60.0
4
Sample Output1:
Enter the price of a dozen mangoes
Enter the price at which 1 mango is being sold
Loss : Rs.12.00

Solution:
dozen_money = float(input())#60.0
one_fruit_sold = float(input())#4
one_fruit_money = dozen_money//12
if one_fruit_money > one_fruit_sold:
    loss = dozen_money - 12*one_fruit_sold
    print("Enter the price of a dozen mangoes")
    print("Enter the price at which 1 mango is being sold ")
    print("Loss: Rs."+str("%.2f"%loss))
elif one_fruit_money < one_fruit_sold:
    profit = 12*one_fruit_sold - dozen_money
    print("Enter the price of a dozen mangoes ")
    print("Enter the price at which 1 mango is being sold")
    print("Profit: Rs."+str("%.2f"%profit))
else:
    print("Enter the price of a dozen mangoes ")
    print("Enter the price at which 1 mango is being sold")
    print("No profit nor loss")
