Dora is interested so much in gardening and she plants more trees in her garden. She plants trees in a rectangular fashion with the order of rows and columns and
numbered the trees in row-wise order. She planted the mango tree only in a 1st row, 1st column and last column. So given the tree number, your task is to find whether
the given tree is a mango tree or not?Write a program to check whether the given number is a mango tree or not. 
Sample Input:
5
5
11  
Sample Output:
Yes

Solution:

no_of_rows = int(input())
no_of_columns = int(input())
m_tree_no = int(input())
result_1 = False
result_2 = False
result_3 = False
#1st_row
for i in range(1,no_of_columns+1):
    if i == m_tree_no:
        result1_1 = True
        break
#1st column
sum = 1
for j in range(1,no_of_columns+1):
    if sum == m_tree_no:
        result_2 = True
        break
    else:
        sum = sum + no_of_columns
#last column
for i in range(1,no_of_rows+1):
    if no_of_columns*i == m_tree_no:
        result1_3 = True
        break
if result_1 or result_2 or result_3:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
