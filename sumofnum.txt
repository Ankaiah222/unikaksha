Write a program to find the sum of numbers in a given range is discussed here. Given the starting and ending interval, the sum of all the numbers in that range will 
be displayed as output.
Sample Input 1:
1
10
Sample Output 1:
55

Solution:
m = int(input())
n = int(input())
sum = 0
for i in range(m,n+1):
    sum = sum + i
print(sum)
