Program to find if the given numbers are Friendly pair or not (Amicable or not) is discussed here. 
Sample Input:
6
28
Sample Output:
Friendly Pair

Solution:
first_number = int(input())
second_number = int(input())
sum_1 = 0
sum_2 = 0
for i in range(1,first_number+1):
    if first_number % i == 0:
        sum_1 = sum_1 + i
for j in range(1,second_number+1):
    if second_number % j == 0:
        sum_2 = sum_2 + j
if (first_number / sum_1) == (second_number/sum_2):
    print("Friendly Pair")
else:
    print("Not Friendly Pair ")
