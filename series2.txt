Write a program to generate the following series --- 6,11,21,36,56,... 
Sample Input:
5
Sample Output:
6 11 21 36 56 

Solution:
n = int(input())
n1 = n
if n > 5:
    n1 = 5
sum = n1 + 1
result = str(sum) +" "
for i in range(1,n):
    sum = sum + n1*i
    result = result + str(sum)+" "
print(result)
